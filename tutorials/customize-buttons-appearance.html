	<strong>Kind reminder:</strong>
	This tutorial is made for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/juiz-social-post-sharer/">Nobs • Share Buttons</a> (ex-Juiz Social Post Sharer) plugin available on the WordPress repository but also <a href="https://github.com/geoffreycrofte/juiz-social-post-sharer">on Github</a>.
</p>


<h2>
	Ways to achieve customization
</h2>

<p>
	With Nobs • Share Buttons, the customization possibilies are almost infinite, weither you are a plugin ou a theme developer, or you know a bit of CSS and want to adjust the styling.
</p>

<p>
	To best guide you through the different options for customizing the look of your buttons, I have divided this page into several sections, but you can totally combine these options.
</p>

<h3 id="start-with-existing">
	Start with an existing Button Skin	
</h3>

<p>
	The best way to tweak a little bit the styles of the buttons if to start from an existing theme, the closest one to what you want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
	To do so, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Got to the admin page <strong>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Nobs • Share Buttons&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Themes &amp; Networks</strong></li>
	<li>Pick a theme from the existing list</li>
	<li>Then select the social buttons you wanna display</li>
</ol>

<p>
	From here, you have a theme applied with a built-in CSS file. You will now have to add CSS properties to your current WordPress Theme. I think that a precise styling is, oftentime, related to the look of your theme, that's why I think it's the best place to adjust styling.

<h3 id="create-a-skin">
	Create a brand new skin for your buttons
</h3>

<p>
	If you want to create a reusable skin over your themes and website, it might be more interesting for you to build a custom plugin or a skin folder within your themes.	
</p>

<p>
	To do so, here are dedicated tutorials to help you with these tasks, step by step.

	<li><a href="tutorial-create-buttons-skin.html#theme">Create skin folder in my theme</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="add-features">
	Add features, new buttons, etc.
</h2>

<p>
	Another way to customize your buttons, is by adding one or several new buttons for you favorite social networks.
</p>

<p>
	To do so, you need to better know how this plugin is built to exploit its full power. But if you are not technical at all, or if you feel a bit too busy lately, don't hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/geoffreycrofte/juiz-social-post-sharer/issues/new">open an issue</a> on the Github repository. I'll take time to read and evaluate your request on my spare time.
</p>

<h3 id="custom-button">
	Add a social network via the Button API.
</h3>

<p>
	You can add a new social network quite easily by following some steps. Before you start, know that you will need some elements to achieve all of that successfully:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A share URL API provided by your social network.</li>
	<li>An icon for you social network (SVG is best)</li>
	<li>2 colors in hexadecimal, related to the <a href="https://brandcolors.net/" target="_blank">brand color</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you meet the requirements, you can follow the following tutorial.

</p>

<h3 id="customize-email">
	Customize email button
</h3>

<p>
	If you've activated the Email button, you probably already found out that there is a modal window option when you click on this button. But also that you can pick one or another option among this modal and custom texts being shared.
</p>

<p>
	To better understand how everything works, I invite you to follow this tutorial on the email customization.
